katy-table-33:
  place-id: table-33
  review-text: This is one of the most gluten-free-friendly restaurants in the Dayton region. Everything they bake in-house is gluten free (including their brownies and muffins, which are delicious), although they do bring in regular bread and buns for their sandwiches and burgers. I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles and the Quiche.

  review-text: I'm in love with Table 33! Upon my first visit I tried the quiche, which was wonderfully delicious. The light, flaky crust was an absolute delight. My second visit was even better! I chose the gluten-free Bananas Foster Waffles. They were A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! Brown sugar syrup, bananas and blueberries layered on top of a perfectly browned waffle. The menu also listed an amazing selection of gluten-free baked goods. I'm looking forward to my next visit!

  review-text: My first experience with Zombie Dogz was at an event catered by their food truck. I had the Killer Gauge dog with slow cooked buffalo chicken topped with blue cheese crumbles, celery bits and drizzled in ranch dressing. It was pretty amazing. I was extremely excited to learn that they offer gluten free hot dog buns. WINNER! Recently I visited their location on Brown Street and tried the Juan of Dead featuring slow cooked bbq pulled pork topped with shredded swiss cheese, diced dill pickles and drizzled with yellow mustard. It was good, but not as good as the Killer Gauge.

  place-id: basils-on-market
  review-text: I prefer the lunch menu versus the dinner menu at Basil's. There are more gluten free options available during lunch. The open faced caprese (minus the bread) and the market toss salad are my favorites! The truffle fries are also pretty aweseme! Basil's has two locations, one in Dayton and the original in Troy. I have always found the service and the food better at the Troy location. The Dayton location has a great view of the river and a fantastic outdoor patio.

  review-text: Crepe Boheme at the 2nd Street Public Market has become my go-to for lunch on Thursdays. I've never had a crepe there that I didn't love! The teriyaki chicken at Isaan Baan Thai Noi is my second favorite choice for lunch. For a delicious treat, I highly recommend Sweet P's Handcrafted Ice Pops or the Extreme Toffee coffee from Caffeine Carl's.

katy-bareburger:
  place-id: bareburger
  review-text: Bareburger is basically a burger, fries, and shakes kind of place, although they do offer salads and other sandwiches. They have a list of specialty burgers to choose from or you can build your own. You can get burgers made from beef, bison, black beans, duck, elk, quinoa, grilled lemon chicken, sesame ginger beef, sweet potato and wild rice, turkey, or wild boar. All except the black bean and quinoa are gluten free. For your bun, to keep it gluten free you can choose to have your burger on a tapioca bun, with no bun, served on a lettuce bed, or wrapped with a collard. Their french fries and sweet potato fries are fried separately and kept gluten free. Other gluten free items are listed clearly on the menu. Beyond their burgers and fries, I also highly recommend trying their milkshakes. My personal favorite is the Mexican Chocolate, made with chocolate ice cream, cayenne, cinnamon, and a “torched marshmallow.” Just thinking about it makes me want one.

  place-id: sleepy-bee-cafe
  review-text: The Sleepy Bee Cafe in Oakley, near Cincinnati (they also have a location in Blue Ash), is a very cute little restaurant. I visited on a Friday morning around 9:30 and the place was almost full. The food was delicious, I had the gluten free Bee Cakes—made with almond, quinoa, and buckwheat flour—and bacon and while the pancakes were heavier than normal pancakes, they weren't gritty at all. The only drawback was the space got very loud and it became difficult to have a conversation.

  review-text: I found out about Bagger Dave's through the Gluten Free Ohio blog (glutenfreeohio.com). It has since become a favorite. I love that I can just get a burger without a bun and that the french fries and sweet potato chips are fried in separate friers and kept gluten free. My favorites are the Bacon BBQ Burger and the Saucy Sicilian Pizza Burger.

  place-id: gaucho
  review-text: Affectionately known as 'the meat hut' in the Sparkbox offices, I knew that my first visit to Pittsburgh would require a visit to Gaucho. Friends from Pittsburgh recommended sharing the Parrillada Mixta featuring over a pound of New York strip steak, grilled chicken breast and sweet -or- spicy chorizo paired with a side of Papas al Horno (oven roasted red potatoes with whole garlic cloves and fresh rosemary). It was fantastic! A word of warning when visiting Gaucho, be prepared to wait. Don't worry, it's worth it!

  review-text: Big perk - they deliver sushi (but probably not downtown)! They also have several standard Thai and other cooked dishes for parties looking for variety. And it's consistently delicious. Their actual speed can be slightly hit or miss, so make sure you have time to wait if needed. They've been generous the few times it's been slow, though.

While they are known for their espresso, they also carry a small selection of baked goods. I highly recommend Press for your Dayton caffeine fix. The only issue is their wifi is not very good so this is not a good place to go and get work done. Otherwise, the atmosphere is great for chatting. Parking along the street or in a vacant lot across the road. The Oregon District, library, riverfront, Sparkbox office, and other Dayton attractions are within walking distance.

Their queso starter and fresh chips are addicting. They have burgers on Tuesday, so be warned if you're coming in for tacos. They also make these very yummy Auga Fresca drinks.

Whether this is a lunch cookie, or a cookie you enjoy as a snack for a few days, I highly recommend Colangelo's chocolate chip cookies!
