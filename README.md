**Sparkboxers review food and drink places so you can eat well**  
Built with Handlebars, Sass, and Node.js

Welcome to Sparkeats! The purpose of this site is to provide reviews and recommendations from sparkboxers of places we love to eat and drink.

## To Run the Site Locally
Instructions for running the site locally are saved in a wiki here: [https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Running-Sparkeats-Locally](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Running-Sparkeats-Locally)

## To Contribute to the Site
Are you a sparkboxer who wants to add a review? Great! The first thing you need to do is create a new branch:
1. Click the dropdown button at the top of the page that says **Branch: master**.
2. In the box where it says "Find or create a branch...", enter a name for your branch.
    * Your branch name should include your name and the name of the place you are reviewing. For example *jane-magically-marvelous-macarons*
3. You can either hit <enter>/<return> or click on the **Create Branch** button that has appeared below.
4. The dropdown button at the top of the page should now read **Branch: jane-magically-marvelous-macarons**.

Then, go to the Sparkeats site ([http://eats.seesparkbox.com/](http://eats.seesparkbox.com/)) and see if the place you want to review is already listed there.

If it is, all you need to do is add your review! You can find the instructions for adding a review here: [https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Review](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Review)

If it is not, you will need to add some information about your place as well: [https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Place](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Place)

Once you are done adding your information, review, and any images you want to add ([https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-Images](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-Images)), you will need to submit a pull request:
1. From the main repository page, click **New Pull Request**
2. **Click `New Pull Request`**
3. Add any additional information you think is necessary and click **Create Pull Request**
5. **Add Assignees**: Heather Taylor and Katy Bowman.

Thanks for your help!
